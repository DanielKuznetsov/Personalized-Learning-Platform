      In a professional context it often happens that private or corporate
      clients corder a publication to be made and presented with the actual
      content still not being ready. Think of a news blog that's filled with

      disregarding the layout and its elements. Besides, random text risks to be
      unintendedly humorous or offensive, an unacceptable risk in corporate
      environments. Lorem ipsum and its many variants have been employed since
      the early 1960ies, and quite likely since the sixteenth century.
